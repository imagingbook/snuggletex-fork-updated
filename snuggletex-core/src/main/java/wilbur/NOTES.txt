Wilbur:

* Very elaborate, mainly aimed at math translation to XML.
* Problem with \ref command (not registered, marked as "text").
* Does not nest commands properly
* Quite a few dependencies!
* Look at definitions in uk.ac.ed.ph.snuggletex.definitions.CorePackageDefinitions

* see https://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/snuggletex/documentation/overview-and-features.html
* http://snuggletex.sourceforge.net/maven/xref/index.html

API Docs: http://snuggletex.sourceforge.net/maven/apidocs/index.html

Added missing '/src/main/resources/uk/ac/ed/ph/snuggletex/all-math-characters.txt' from Maven distribution

*** Fazit: ***
Forget Snuggletex. 
Misses out on simple things, such as finding '\ref'.
Appears too complex to fix.
